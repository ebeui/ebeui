# Hi there, I'm Diane 👋 

## About Me

Hello to all my fellow data enthusiasts! Armed with a strong data science background and fueled by an unwavering passion for health and wellness, I thrive on transforming raw data into impactful solutions that directly address real health challenges. There's nothing more exhilarating than delving into diverse datasets and uncovering those hidden gems of insight. I firmly believe in the power of collaborative teamwork and I'm genuinely excited to contribute to projects that are driven by data and geared towards improving health outcomes. Let's embark on this transformative journey together! 🌟🤝

## 🌱 Data Science Projects

I'm always working on exciting data science projects that showcase my abilities and demonstrate the power of data-driven solutions. Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **[Tasty Trail](https://github.com/ebeui/restaurant_recommender_system)**: Tasty Trail is a modern restaurant recommendation system that helps you discover the perfect dining spots for delightful culinary experiences. Craft a user-friendly restaurant recommendation system that understands individual preferences, resulting in delightful dining experiences and stronger customer loyalty.

- **[Cardiovascular Disease Prediction](https://github.com/ebeui/heart_disease_prediction)**: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is critical for effective treatment. However, identifying patients at risk of cardiovascular disease can be challenging, as it often involves analyzing multiple health metrics and medical history. A machine learning model for cardiovascular disease prediction can streamline this process and provide accurate and timely diagnoses, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.
